  Dovetail - Web engineer coding challenge
</h1>

Prepare for your coding challenge with this boilerplate. This boilerplate ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need to get up and running for the coding challenge. Please have this installed and working on your computer prior to attending!

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Clone this repo and install dependencies**

    ```shell
    yarn
    ```

    Note: Make sure you're on node 18 (we use node 18.8).

2.  **Start it up!**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    yarn start
    ```

    Your site should now be running at `http://localhost:8000`

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Open the repo up in your code editor of choice. You can choose from developing in either javascript or typescript for the coding challenge. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

4.  **Get comfy!**

    You are welcome to install any additional libraries, restructure code/components/naming and change anything in this repo to suit what you beleive makes for the cleanest, comfiest coding environment. We recommend you get your favoured style library installed if you feel it will help you.

    The breakpoints for the responsive sizes during this challenge will just be between mobile and desktop at 960px and the max page width for the content will be 1120px.

## The challenge

The details of the actual challenge will be shared with you during the interview. However, some preliminary information to help you prepare is below:

1. The challenge will be comprised of a responsive figma design where you will be asked to develop a solution that responsively matches the figma design as closely as possible. At the start of the challenge we will provide you with a figma file and you will be asked to build a solution based off this file and the content found in `src/constants/content.ts`.

1. You will not be tested on your knowledge of Gatsby. You are not expected/required to leverage any Gatsby specific features if you are not familiar with them.

1. This boilerplate includes 3 pages. Any components you create can be placed within the `/src/components` directory in whatever structure you think is most appropriate. The current structure of the files within the components folder is open for you to modify prior to starting the challenge if you feel it could be improved.

   a. `/src/pages/index.jsx`

   b. `/src/pages/javascript.jsx` - build your solution within this page if you wish to code in javascript.

   c. `/src/pages/typescript.jsx` - build your solution within this page if you wish to code in typescript.

1. Prior to commencing to the test, you are welcome to restructure/rename any components/files, rename any variables and install any libraries which you feel will benefit you. We encourage you to select a style library of your choice (e.g. at Dovetail we use [@emotion/styled](https://emotion.sh/docs/styled)) to assist with building and styling your components. You are welcome to refactor any styles into this library before the test commences. However, if you are happy just using .css for styles that is okay too. Just make sure your environment is working locally when you arrive!

## FAQs

### How long will i have during the exercise?

There is roughly 30-40 minutes allotted to work through the exercise. Afterwards we can discuss anything else you would have liked to have added and then proceed with a discussion on any personal work you feel you would like to share with us.

### What if i run out of time?

The task is not designed to be 100% completed within the allotted time. The challenge is designed simply to see how you break down a problem and approach building something from a design file. It is not specifically intended to assess your on-the-spot coding skill. If you are unable to complete the task in time do not worry! We can talk through any remaining pieces that you do not complete afterwards.

### Can i ask questions during the challenge?

Of course! You are encouraged to clarify anything and everything. Try to talk us through your solution and share your thinking. We are happy to help if you need clarification on any details.

### Can i use Google, chatGPT or my own code?

You are more than welcome to google, use chatGPT or your own code to help you build your solution. Just be prepared to explain your code if you are copying it from other sources.

### Do i need to deploy my code?

Nope! We aren't expecting to see any code hosted anywhere.
